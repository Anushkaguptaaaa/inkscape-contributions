Inkscape
--------

Inkscape is (or at least should be) a vector illustrator program for
the GNOME environment.  It is currently in active development and
approaching general usability.

If you are more interested in hacking, you can also try out
KIllustrator, Gill and sketch. Inkscape eagerly borrows code from
every other free program under the Sun (hey - isn't it the main point
about free software?)

You can always find the freshest Inkscape at GNOME CVS.  The official
homepage is http://inkscape.org/ You can also find links
to the binary & source code packages there.

Inkscape uses the standard procedure for compilation and installation: 

./configure
make
make install

If a "./configure" file is not present, you can create it by running
the "./autogen.sh" command, which calls in turn a number of other
programs such as automake and autoconf.  See INSTALL for more
details. 

You need reasonably recent gnome installation including the -devel-
libraries. Helix Gnome + gnome-print 0.21 (or higher) + bonobo 0.17
(or higher) should do it.  You can also add --without-bonobo to
configure command line to disable HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL bonobo support

If you modify Inkscape in any usable way, please let us know also.

Some demo pictures could have absolute paths for imported images. So if they
do not display correctly, tune them with a good text editor.

Some guidelines:

Command line:
-z, --without-gui         do not open GUI, useful for printing SVG documents
-f --file filename        open file
-p --print outputfile     prints file (use "| lpr" for pipelining)

Ctrl & Shift modify dragging behaviour in some modes
Shift click/rubberband usually toggles selection
Snapping to guidelines/grid work only for certain modes
To break line (or add node) select its endpoints
It should import png, bmp, jpg, xpm & gif bitmaps and svg vector images.
Open can handle only svg graphics
