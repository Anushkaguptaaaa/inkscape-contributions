Inkscape. Draw Freely.
======================

http://www.inkscape.org/

Inkscape is an open source drawing tool with capabilities similar to
Illustrator, Freehand, and CorelDraw that uses the W3C standard scalable
vector graphics  format (SVG). Some supported SVG features include
basic shapes, paths, text, markers, clones, alpha blending, transforms,
gradients, and grouping. In addition, Inkscape supports Creative Commons
meta-data, node-editing, layers, complex path operations, text-on-path,
and SVG XML editing. It also imports several formats like EPS, Postscript,
JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF and exports PNG as well as multiple vector-based
formats.

Inkscape's main motivation is to provide the Open Source community
with a fully W3C compliant XML, SVG, and CSS2 drawing tool. Additional
planned work includes conversion of the codebase from C/Gtk to C++/Gtkmm,
emphasizing a lightweight core with powerful features added through
an extension mechanism, and the establishment of a friendly, open,
community-oriented development processes.

Inkscape uses the standard procedure for compilation and installation: 

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If a "./configure" file is not present, you can create it by running
the "./autogen.sh" command, which calls in turn a number of other
programs such as automake and autoconf.  See INSTALL for more
details. 

Please see http://www.inkscape.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CompilingInkscape for the
most current dependencies.

If you install dependencies to non-standard locations, such as
installing XML::Parser someplace in your home directory, you may need to
take some extra steps to indicate where those dependencies are to be
found.  For instance, with Perl modules, set the PERLLIB or PERL5LIB
variable (see `man perlrun`)

If you modify Inkscape in any usable way, please let us know.

Please see the file HACKING for further information on developing Inkscape.
