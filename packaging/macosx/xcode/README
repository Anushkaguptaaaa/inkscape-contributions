# This folder contains an Inkscape solution containing an inkscape project
# plus an inscape app project. Inkscape is the default binary, and InkscapeApp 
# is meant to eventually contain the inkscape mac app.
# Make sure you have all the dependancies installed on your machine.
# Easiest way is to run:
sudo port install inkscape
sh autogen.sh
make

# After these 3 commands, you should be able to work from the Xcode Solution.
