howto create windows msi installer

you need:
1. WiX Toolset (aka Windows Installer XML)
   get it from http://wixtoolset.org/
   (3.10 works fine at the time of this writing)

build the installer
1. build inkscape
2. open command shell "cmd"
3. change current directory to inkscape\packaging\wix
4. set environment variables using
     wixenv.bat    (adjust paths in the file if necessary!)
5. create installer using
     install.bat

when completed there should be inkscape.msi in your path

- better filenames (nightly builds versus releases)
- howto remove python .pyc files after deinstallation

helpful tips
