Keyboard shortcuts

   Unless  noted otherwise, keypad keys (such as arrows, Home, End, +, -,
   digits)  are  supposed to work the same as corresponding regular keys.
   Some  of  the  keys  (e.g.  arrows)  currently  only work if the mouse
   pointer is over the document canvas; hopefully this will be fixed in a
   later  version.  See also KeyboardShortcutsToDo on Inkscape Wiki for a 
   discussion of other shortcuts we're planning  to  implement;  you  can 
   leave your ideas and requests there.

          Esc or  any  non-hex  character  quits  Unicode  mode. For
          example, Ctrl+u 2 0 1 4 Esc inserts an em-dash.

     * Ctrl+Space     insert non-break space

          A  non-break  space  is  visible  even in a text object without
          xml:space="preserve".
