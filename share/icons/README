The icons in this folder are in transition. The general idea is that
all XPMs are moving to SVGs to better support SVG use within our SVG
editor, Inkscape.

Thus, the XPMs need to be placed into icons.svg and the XPMs should be
removed, or moved into some compressed historical archive.  The Makefile.am
has the list of in-use XPMs, along with the definitions in
src/inkscape-stock.h/cpp.  Please keep them in sync.

The only graphics that will be kept as XPMs will be the cursor
icons. (REJON: I"m actually in favor of trying to convert these to SVGs
as well.)  These files are located in src/pixmaps.
