CHANGING ICON THEMES
--------------------
The Inkscape icons are read from the file icons.svg that resides in the same
directory as this README.

If you want to try the new theme created by David Christian Berg, make a
directory named 'icons' in your personal inkscape directory ($HOME/.inkscape),
copy the file David_icons.svg in that directory and rename it to icons.svg. The
next time Inkscape is started the alternative icons will be used.


CREATING A NEW ICON THEME
-------------------------
In order to create a new theme or simply modify some icons you need to
make sure each icon is assigned the correct id (its name). Opening
'icons.svg' in Inkscape and selecting an icon will display its id in the XML
editor (Shift+Ctrl+X).

The simplest way to proceed is to work on a copy of the icons.svg file and
modify each icon one after the other, using the XML editor to adapt its id.

For example, if you've just finished drawing a new pen icon, select it on the
canvas, then open the XML editor. The node corresponding to the pen icon will be
highlighted. Click on its id in the upper right panel of the XML editor.
The bottom right panel will display something like 'g2570'. Change that value to
'draw_pen' and click the 'Set' button.
