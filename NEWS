Inkscape 0.92.3 is a stability and bugfix release. For a complete list of bugs
fixed in 0.92.3, see the Launchpad milestone page.

Improvements

Command line usage

  • support --export-area-drawing when exporting to SVG.
  • support --export-area-page when using --export-id to export to SVG
  • support --export-margin when exporting to SVG

Text tool

  • support for switching between RTL and LTR writing directions (on narrow
    screens, find it by unfolding the overhang menu for the text tool's tool
    controls by clicking on the triangle at the far right)

Circle/ellipse/arc tool

  • add fields for setting vertical/horizontal radius (Rx/Ry) to toolbar. (Bug
    #1181127)

PDF+LaTeX export

  • Add support for multiline text with basic support for line-spacing
    attribute (Bug #771959)
    Note: Currently only the line-spacing of the top level text element is
    considered, i.e. all lines in one text element share the same line spacing.
    Note: LaTeX is much more clever with respect to line spacing, so layout
    might not always be exactly the same as in Inkscape
    Note: Make sure to use a continuously scalable font in LaTeX, otherwise 
    results might be unexpected.

Preferences

  • New option "Rendering tile multiplier" added. This value... (please someone
    explain its effect - not what it does, that's in the tool tip, and doesn't
    help deciding what one needs. Does it speed up drawing? Which setting is
    good on low-end/high-end hardware?)

Regression fixes

  • Potentially missing command line output in Inkscape 0.92.2 on Windows 7.
    (Bug #1714278)
  • Raster extensions relying on ImageMagick were broken in Inkscape 0.92.2 on
    Windows. (Bug #1716516)
  • gcodetools were creating wrong orientation points since the dpi change had
    been made for Inkscape 0.92 (Bug #1680760)
  • Regression on 0.92.2 makes it impossible to fill a powerstroke shape (Bug #
    1715433)

Important bugfixes

  • Fix crash when attempting to drag path at cap or line join. (Bug #1691406)
  • Inkscape process did not exit cleanly on Windows. (Bugs #1412365 and #
    1715339, also causing #1714278)
  • File extension was sometimes omitted when adding saved files to Windows'
    list of "recently used documents" resulting in unusable links ([1])
  • Do not crash on systems with illegal fontconfig configurations. (Bug #
    1716516)
  • Resolve issues when attempting to save files to non-existing directories.
    Could happen for shortcuts.xml (Bug #1719629) and when setting the autosave
    location manually.
  • Allow cancellation of bitmap export. (Bug #1195929)
  • Fix issues with PDF+LaTeX export: wrong stacking of text/graphics / missing
    pages in PDF output (Bugs #771957, #1417470)
  • Fix shortcuts not working as expected when a non-latin keyboard layout is
    the primary keyboard layout on a system. (Bugs #1226962, #1730246, #1734308
    )
  • Printing multiple copies of the document resulted in one copy and many
    blank pages (Bug #490866)
  • Fix OpenDocument Graphics (.odg) export which failed when including linked
    images and was not working at all on Windows (Bug #1691406)

Documentation

The Inkscape documentation repository, containing the man page, the keyboard
shortcut list as well as the tutorials and their respective translation files,
has been almost completely refactored (Java has been dropped in favor of
Python), and was updated to work with git and gitlab.

Contributions to the documentation translations, as well as improvements to its
contents, are welcome at the inkscape-docs repository
