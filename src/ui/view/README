This directory contains the class Inkscape::UI::View::View and related items.

View is an abstract base class for all UI document views. Documents
can be displayed by more than one window, each having its own view
(e.g. zoom level, selection, etc.).

View is the base class for:

* SPDesktop
* SVGView  REMOVED

SPViewWidget is the base for:

* SPDocumentWidget

(It was also base for SPSVGViewWidget but that has been replaced by
SVGViewWidget which is derived, rather uselessly, from Gtk::Scrollbar).

SPViewWidget contains a GtkEventBox and holds a View.

SPDesktopWidget contains a
  VBox
   HBox
    GtkGrid
     GtkPaned
      GtkGrid
       SPCanvas
  Plus lots of other junk.

SVGViewWidget is derived from Gtk::Scrollbar. It no longer is dependent
on View (and really doesn't belong here anymore). It contains:
  SPCanvas

To do:

* Convert everything to C++.
* Evaluate moving SPDesktopWidget down the widget stack.
  It doesn't use the EventBox of SPViewWidget!
* Get rid of SPViewWidget, integrating it directly into a
  new C++ Desktop widget.

A DesktopViewWidget should contain:
  DesktopView (aka SPDesktop)
  SPCanvas
