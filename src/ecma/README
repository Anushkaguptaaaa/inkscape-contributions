README file for EcmaScript DOM binding on SVG.
==============================================


Purpose
=======

This is the beginning of what might be a long journey toward
compliance with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3.org)'s
specification for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG):

    http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/

with regards to binding ECMAScript:

    http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm

as defined in this specification:

    http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ecmascript-binding.html


ECMAScript had its origins in Netscape Corporation's Javascript script
language and interpreter, first designed and implemented by Brendan Eich.
In our effort to move toward a full binding between ECMAScript and the SVG
tree, it is fortuitous that the Mozilla Organization (Mozilla.org) provides
this same Javascript engine for use by projects just like ours.


About these files
=================

This directory is a set of utility classes that provides an ECMAScript
window to the SVG tree.  It uses the Mozilla.org 'Spidermonkey' C
JavaScript engine as its ECMA implementation.  Information for this
fine project can be found here:

    http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey


Our copy of their code, with makefiles conforming to our build architecture,
is at:

    $PROJECT_ROOT/inkscape/src/extension/script/js

Mozilla.org's license for these files is at:

http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html

...which describes their tri-license scheme, allowing developers to use
one of:  the Mozilla Public License (MPL), the GNU General Public License
(GPL) and the GNU Limited General Public License (LGPL).   Since we do not
intend to modify Mozilla's source code in any fashion, we wish to use their
library under the LGPL.  Many thanks to Mozilla.org for their generosity.

This is the example SVG file, with scripting from this page:

Getting this interaction to work correctly will be Target #1
on our quest.

More information will be provided here as it becomes available.
