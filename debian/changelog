inkscape (0.37) unstable; urgency=high

  * Boolean operations on shapes are now implemented: union,
	difference, intersection, and exclusive OR (XOR).
  * Paths can be inset or outset (i.e., contracted or expanded
	orthogonally to the path in each point). You can do simple
	inset/outset of a path, or you can create a dynamic offset object
	that you can adjust interactively using the node tool. Moreover, a
	dynamic offset object can be linked to its original path so that
	editing the path will have the offset updated automatically.
  * A stroke can now be converted to a closed path (i.e. outlined,
	taking into account stroke width).
  * A standalone SVG viewer is now available, which can be used as a
	slideshow viewer. Just type inkview *.svg; see
	http://www.inkscape.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Inkview for details.
  * You can now drag SVG files from Konqueror (and probably other
	KDE apps, too) to Inkscape. And when The Gimp gets full support
	for path drag-and-drop, we'll be able to accept drops from them,
	too.
  * The Document Options dialog now lets you change the background
	and border colors of a document, with the background color also
	used for bitmap exports - which means you can easily produce PNGs
	with non-transparent background.
  * Support for the letter-spacing CSS property is
	implemented. Press Alt+< or Alt+> when editing text to adjust the
	letterspacing of the current line.
  * The Help menu contains a new interactive tutorial for beginner
	users of Inkscape and a complete Keys and Mouse reference in SVG
	(see an HTML version at http://inkscape.org/doc/keys.html).

  * Complete keyboard control in selector and node tool: now you can
	not only select and move objects/nodes with keyboard, but also
	rotate them by [] keys and scale by <> keys, with various
	modifiers. For nodes, rotating and scaling is applied to the
	control handles of all selected nodes.
  * The top panel for selector tool provides editable fields for the
	coordinates, width, and height of the selection. Press Alt+X to
	access the panel via keyboard.
  * Maximum zoom was upped from 32x to 256x, which was possible by
	increasing the coordinate precision used by the program and stored
	in SVG.
  * A new color widget on the Fill and Stroke dialog allows you to
	select between RGB, CMYK, HSV sliders or an HSV color wheel
	(resize the dialog if you want the wheel to grow larger). Also in
	that dialog, editing gradients is now easier, as you can drag the
	control points of linear and radial gradients.
  * Many new keyboard+mouse modes make mousework a lot more
	convenient. In selector and node tool, as well as in pen, spiral,
	and star tools, rotating objects or control handles of a node with
	Ctrl restricts rotation to 15 degree increments. Dragging nodes
	may be restricted to horizontal/vertical (with Ctrl) and to the
	directions of the node's handles (with Ctrl+Alt). Dragging a
	node's control points with Alt locks the length of the handle, and
	with Shift, rotates the other handle by the same angle.
  * In selector, Ctrl+click and Ctrl+Shift+click select objects
	within groups.
  * In node tool, Ctrl+click toggles cusp/smooth/symmetric,
	Ctrl+Alt+click deletes a node.
  * Previously in selector, mouse dragging from an empty spot
	started rubberband selection, while dragging from an object moved
	that object. Now you can press Shift and Inkscape will start
	rubberband from any spot, object or not. This makes selecting in
	complex drawings more convenient.

  * When you save a document, Inkscape now remembers the zoom level
	and the center of view and restores them on load, so you'll be
	looking at exactly the same point at the same magnification as the
	last time you saved the document. Optionally, it also saves window
	size and position for each document and restores them on
	load. Moreover, Inkscape can read the view template from the
	preferences to set the zoom level, window geometry, grid settings,
	and guides in all new documents.
  * More helpful statusbar display: default hints for all tools,
	explanations for most non-fatal errors, visual feedback for
	non-trivial actions (such as Unicode mode in text tool), the
	number and type of selected nodes in node tool, the font face and
	size for text objects.
  * Ctrl+Tab and Shift+Ctrl+Tab cycle forward and backward through
	the document windows of the program.
  * Inkscape now preserves the history of zoom settings for each
	document. The ` key restores previous zoom; pressing ` repeatedly
	will guide you through all the zoom settings you've used in this
	session. Shift+` moves forward in the zoom history.
  * Middle click zooms in, Shift+middle click zooms out (in addition
	to middle button drag which pans canvas).
  * All zooming operations via mouse now preserve the point under
	cursor (no centering).
  * Improvements in the Export dialog: the Browse button, helpful
	error messages, and even a progress bar. The dialog remembers and
	restores the export area and dpi settings.
  * The fullscreen mode is implemented; press F11 to toggle.
  * F12 temporarily hides all open dialogs; press F12 again to
	restore them.
  * More screen real estate: you can now hide rulers (Ctrl+R) and
	scrollbars (Ctrl+B). These settings are remembered across
	sessions.
  * All menus now have mnemonics.
  * Many obsolete and confusing console debug messages removed, some
	of them reworded in plain English and displayed in the statusbar
	or (for important errors) in modal messageboxes.
  * Many cosmetic improvements in the UI.

  * Inkscape is now built using a C++ compiler. More and more code
	is being translated from C to C++.
  * In particular, we now use NR::Point, NR::Matrix and NR::Rect
	classes instead of the clunky old macros.
  * We now have the beginnings of an Inkscape::URI class for working
	with URIs.
  * Using Inkscape::URIReference, clipping paths, masks, and
	gradients are updated properly when their id is changed.
  * Inkscape can use libgnomeprint 2.2 now (Note: it should print to
	the gnome default printer, but was not fully tested before the
	release)
  * Massive cleanups, bugfixes, and trimming dead code.
