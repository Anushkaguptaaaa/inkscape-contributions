To create the about.svg from the about_svg.tmpl, do this:

   * Edit the template and replace [% Release %] with the
     current release number and [% Contributors %] with the contents of
     the AUTHORS file.  Save as about.svg.

   * Load the about.svg in an SVG editor.  Resize the Contributors block
     to fit in the page.  Center the revision with the other text.

   * Convert the text to curves, so that if someone using the program
     doesn't happen to have the proper fonts installed, the page layout
     doesn't get out of line.

   * Save about.svg and commit to CVS

   * Ponder about how the above process could be automated.
