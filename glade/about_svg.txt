To create the about.svg from the about_svg.tmpl, do this:

   * Edit the template in a text editor and replace [% Release %] with
     the current release number and [% Contributors %] with the contents
     of the AUTHORS file.  Save as about.svg.

   * Load the about.svg in an SVG editor.  Resize the Contributors block
     to fit in the page.  You may need to open the text editor once on
     the block in order for it to catch the line wrapping properly.
     Center the revision with the other text.

   * Convert the text to curves, so that if someone using the program
     doesn't happen to have the proper fonts installed, the page layout
     doesn't get out of line.

   * Save about.svg and commit to CVS

   * Ponder about how the above process could be automated.
