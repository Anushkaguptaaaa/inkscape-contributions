Maximilian Albert (5):
      Fix for issue where creating a new document smashes/mutilates a 3D box.
       (LP: #195373)
      Fix to avoid adding a new perspective each time a file is opened by checking
       if a perspective is already present in the document and using it in this
       case.
      Fix for crash when copy/pasting 3DBox between documents.  Ensures
       perspectives are copied.
      Fix degenerate perspective due to collinear X and Z vanishing points
       and origin, which caused computing preimages of canvas points to
       not work.
      Fixes crash when using using the 3d box by removing debug callback
       functions.  Corresponds to mainline svn commit 17471.

Simon Dahlbacka (1):
      Trivial patch that replaces HKLM with HKCU.  The issue is that
       src/RegistryTool.cpp wants to write to HKLM to which normal users
       doesn't have access, and therefore perspective effect (and everything
       else that use registrytool) blows up.

Tavmjong Bah (1):
      Fixes p3, p6 modes in clonetiler by addressing cases where w<=h.
       (Closes LP: #199387)
      Fix tile clone random scaling (bug #184668, r17511).

       of LP: #187431, #181799, #169066, #169017, #169058, #171322, and perhaps
       others.

a_b (8):

      Adding news for the release

bulia byak  (11):
      Fix issue with tile clones where blue is not displayed when using the
       blur tab.  This patch forces a document update.
      Fix issue where creating a pattern reverses the object order, by
       re-reversing the objects after creation.  (LP: #199791)
      A purely cosmetic change - make the filter effects dialog less wide
      Fix for freeze on load with too large initial scroll
      Patch for inkex.py, to fix current_layer bug, where inkex.py fails to
       determine the current layer.  (LP: #198404)
      Fix for issue where for some reason entering a 3D box as group was
       disabled - this is in fact quite useful so I enabled it (safe
       change for consistency)
      Fix for issue where default perspective was arbitrary and hard-coded
       - I made it depend on document size which makes more sense (not
       really a bug but a safe change)
      Fix issue where converting 3d box to curves or ungrouping it lost
       style and clip/mask, and lost selection
      Fix issue where squeezing a rectangle to zero in one dimension by
       handle misbehaved
      Fix issue where 3d box handles didn't snap
      Use consistent name

cilix42 (3):
      warning cleanup
      Clean up comments and remove (already commented) debugging messages
      Don't crash when the original of an SPUse can't be found. This sort
       of fixes LP 185734, but maybe further action would be appropriate
       (e.g., should we remove orphaned items from the xml tree in the
       first place?).
